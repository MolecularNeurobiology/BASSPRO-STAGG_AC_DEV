Notes:
    Loading multiple wrong files when selecting the meta-data crashed the program


Improvements:
    Program remembers last directory you opened a file and uses that location for file dialogue
        Or remembers per file selection button

    Size of BASSPro basic settings exceeds screen
        This happened when there was no selection of BASSPro settings prior
        This happened on a multiple monitor setup

    When leaving max display for the main window, the window changed size and exceeded main monitor screen
        After this happened the main window entered a strange minimized state that I was unable to recover from

    Check time stamps makes program hang
        Consider having a progress bar or a simple message indicating work is being done

Questions:
    Does any data/configuration persist in the program for example the default directory
        or must a user select this anytime the program is run
